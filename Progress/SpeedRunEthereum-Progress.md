## 🚩 Challenge 1: 🥩 Decentralized Staking App

In this challenge, I created a decentralized staking application where users can coordinate a group funding effort. If the users cooperate, the money is collected in a second smart contract. If they defect, the worst that can happen is everyone gets their money back. The users only have to trust the code.

Deployed contract: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x5dca495f2d2f19c7d792dc9c742ec1f36f2825cf  
Deployed front-end: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWzRVhkub9U7WN5Jpwx8wPsyCvagfah53qVJBRsLbxdx1

## 🚩 Challenge 2: 🏵 Token Vendor

For this challenge I made a decentralized, digital currency(ERC-20) Then, I build an unstoppable "vending machine" that will allow users to buy and sell the currency.

Deployed contract: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x0f05d5935bde1d4ae4767f00e63193eb95cb37f4

## 🚩 Challenge 3: 🎲 Dice Game

In this challenge I learned to create Psuedo random numbers using block hash and how that can be exploited.  I Attacked the dice game with my own contract to predicting the randomness ahead of time to always roll a winner!

Deployed contract: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x69b09aBc0cAABec052dBb983759f7fC0aae24A5C

## 📺 State Channel Application Challenge

In this challenge i build a simple state channel application. State channels look to increase transaction throughput and decrease cost of opperating a contract byallowing participants to securely transact off-chain while keeping interaction with Ethereum Mainnet at a minimum.

Deployed contract: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x83d67e69ad097027630472b0302e3b6c10bf7e9b
